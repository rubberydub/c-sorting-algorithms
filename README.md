This is an implementation of mergesort and quicksort in C using explicit stacks.

I wrote it for the University of Melbourne Class Design of Algorithms.

Usage:

Make with makefile.

Then:

./assn1 [q|m] filename

where:

q - quicksort

m - mergesort

filename - name of text file containing input - integers (1 per line).

There is also a python script in tests for dynamic test input creating, testing and plotting of the performance of the two algorithms.

Requires python-matplotlib.

Usage should be obvious.
